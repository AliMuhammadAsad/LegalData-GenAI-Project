It is undisputed that the question of whether the

the checks wer e deposited. Because of this, the only question pr esented on the cr oss motions is
whether ther e is a genuine issue of material fact r egar ding whether Wilson deposited the checks in good
faith. Howe ver, even if the facts ar e undisputed, neither par ty will be entitled t o summar y judgment as a

Unwinding Transactions
The Cour t now looks t o whether the deposit made b y Maxine Wilson with an inv alid power of att orne y
agreement should be unwound. First, the Cour t must determine whether Arkansas law or Louisiana law
governs the unwinding.6 The Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws states that the law of the state
wher e the instrument, the cashier 's checks, is deliv ered go verns unless ther e is notice of the contr ary on
the face of the instrument. Restatement (Second) of Conflicts § 215 (1971). In the pr esent case, the
Cour t does not find notice on the face of any of the cashier 's checks. Thus, because the instruments
were deliv ered b y Maxine Wilson t o Community State Bank in Arkansas, Arkansas law will go vern. Defendant Mar vin ar gues that because Inter venor Wilson and Jennif er Wilson engaged in alleged
fraudulent activity , the funds should be unwound and giv en to the State of Louisiana. Inter venor Wilson
argues that the funds should be unwound and giv en to him because he is a joint owner , and the funds
are subject t o community pr oper ty. At this time, the Cour t does not find that it has sufficient facts fr om either par ty to proceed on this issue.

Cour ts often consult dictionar y definitions fr om when
the statute was enacted t o determine a term 's ordinar y meaning.20 Modern dictionaries define “ within, ”
when used as a pr eposition (as it is her e), as indicating enclosur e or containment; that something is
inside—not be yond—the limit, period, length, r ange, or compass of something else; and most r elevantly ,
that something is in the field, spher e, or scope of something else, such as when something is “ within the
jurisdiction of the state ” or “ within one 's power .”21 Consistently , for example, the United States Supr eme
Cour t held in United States v . Rodgers 22 that a matter is “ within the jurisdiction ” of a go vernmental entity
when the entity has the power t o exercise authority o ver the matter , distinguishing authoriz ed functions
from peripher al matters.23
The statute also uses the undefined term “under ” as a pr eposition. In addition t o those less applicable in

subject t o the authority of or authoriz ed b y another .25 Consistently , in National Association of

TEN 31 LLC SUMMER MOON HOLDINGS LLC v. JOHN TARBOX JORDAN VIMONT CU DESIGNATED MANAGER LLC CU DESIGNATED MANAGER LLC (2025) _ FindLaw,"What is the significance of the ""amount-in-controversy"" requirement in the underlying statute, and how does it impact the court's jurisdiction in this case?","The ""amount-in-controversy"" requirement is significant in determining a court's jurisdiction in this case. In this context, the court is considering whether the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million, as required by the statute. The defendants have asserted that the value of the rights at issue exceeds this threshold, which is a key factor in establishing jurisdiction.

The court is interpreting the pleadings liberally to determine jurisdiction and has noted that the amount-in-controversy allegations do not establish a lack of jurisdiction. The defendants' assertion that the rights at issue exceed $5 million in value is crucial in invoking the court's jurisdiction.

Furthermore, the court is examining whether the amount in controversy applies at the ""action"" level, considering all claims properly joined before the court, rather than as a per claim minimum. This distinction between ""action"" and ""claim"" is important in determining the scope of the jurisdictional requirement.

In summary, the amount-in-controversy requirement plays a significant role in establishing the court's jurisdiction in this case by ensuring that the value of the rights at issue meets the statutory threshold of exceeding $5 million.","[Document: TEN 31 LLC SUMMER MOON HOLDINGS LLC v.

A claim is “ within the cour t's jurisdiction under Subsection (b)” only if the amount in contr oversy in the

Regar dless of whether jurisdiction is pegged t o specific claims or some other aspect of the suit,
Subsection (b)' s jurisdictional gr ant, and its minimum amount in contr oversy, refer to the “ action ”: “the
business cour t has civil jurisdiction ․  in the following actions in which the amount in contr oversy
exceeds $5 million ․ ”51 In fact, all of Section 25A.004' s jurisdictional gr ants r efer to the “ action, ”52 save
one: Subsection (f )'s grant of supplemental jurisdiction r efers t o claims instead.53 This mak es sense, as
supplemental jurisdiction typically applies t o only some claims within an action; the cour t gener ally must
have some independent jurisdiction t o which the supplemental jurisdiction can attach.54 Section
25A.004' s jurisdictional car ve-outs, on the other hand, ar e sometimes stated with r eference t o the
“action ” and other times t o specific “ claims. ”55
Applying these common meanings as underst ood within the context of the statute, the Cour t holds that
jurisdiction under Subsection (b) applies t o the listed categories of “ actions” when the amount in

Having decided that Section 25A.004(b)' s $5 million amount-in-contr oversy r equir ement applies her e, the
Cour t must next determine how it applies. As detailed below , the Cour t concludes that the amount in
contr oversy applies at the “ action ” level, considering all claims pr operly joined befor e the Cour t, rather
than as a per claim minimum. Because Section 25A.004 uses the undefined terms “ action ” and “ claim, ” the Cour t is mindful of the
distinction between these two terms and the diff erences in the wa y the statute uses them. When
undefined,40 the Texas Supr eme Cour t has construed the term “ action ” to refer to a lawsuit or judicial

The documents discuss the Business Court's subject-matter jurisdiction over counterclaims and how the filing of counterclaims relates to the commencement of an action in a civil suit.

Specifically, the documents mention that the Business Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the defendants' counterclaims and address the definition of a counterclaim as a claim filed by a defendant in response to the plaintiff's claim in an existing lawsuit. The discussion also touches on the timing of when an action commences, which includes subsequent pleadings like amended counterclaims.

The Texas Business Organizations Code (TBOC) likely plays a role in defining the procedural requirements and jurisdictional boundaries for business-related disputes in this case. It may provide rules and guidelines that govern the filing and handling of counterclaims in business-related legal matters within the state of Texas.","[Document: YADAV 3T LLC v.

IN RE_ Marie KING (2020) _ FindLaw,What is the significance of the automatic stay in the context of the foreclosure sale of the debtors' home?,"The automatic stay plays a significant role in the context of the foreclosure sale of the debtors' home. The automatic stay is a legal provision that halts most actions by creditors, including foreclosure proceedings, against a debtor who has filed for bankruptcy. In this case, the document mentions that the foreclosure sale and delivery of the Mortgagee's Deed occurred after the debtors filed for bankruptcy but without being hindered by the automatic stay. The failure to record the deed before the imposition of the automatic stay has consequences under section 1322(c) of the bankruptcy law.

The document explains that the property is not considered ""sold"" at any interim point of the process, such as the auction or delivery of the resulting mortgagee's deed, until the entire process is concluded. Merely accepting the highest bid may ""conclude"" a sale under Arkansas law but does not meet the federal law's definition of ""sold"" under 11 U.S.C. § 1322(c). This distinction is crucial because it affects the debtor's ability to cure a default and potentially retain ownership of the property.","[Document: IN RE_ Marie KING (2020) _ FindLaw, Relevance: 0.86]

The Jenkins cour t first r ecogniz ed that section 1322(c) did not pr ovide a conclusiv e guide in these
circumstances, noting that cour ts still diff ered as t o when in the for eclosur e process the pr oper ty was
“sold. ”
The mor e persuasiv e of these two competing interpr etations is that the statut ory language “ sold at a
foreclosur e sale that is conducted in accor dance with applicable non-bankruptcy law” is ambiguous. The
term “for eclosur e sale ” could r efer either t o the for eclosur e process under state law , which is conducted
in numer ous stages, or t o the for eclosur e auction. If Congr ess had intended t o se ver a debt or's ability t o
cure a delinquent mor tgage on the date of the auction, which is typically only one step in the for eclosur e
sale pr ocess, it could ha ve easily done so. One leading commentat or has found significance in the fact
that the statute does not pinpoint a specific e vent as a cut-off point of the debt or's cur e rights. 8 Collier

Accor dingly , Judge Barr y concluded, “in the context of § 1322(c)(1), ‘ sold’

meaning of ‘ sold’ in the context of § 1322(c)(1). ” Id. at *7. 3. This Case: A Logical Extension of the Trilogy
Returning t o the case at hand, the for eclosur e sale and deliv ery of the Mor tgagee 's Deed occurr ed post-
petition but unhinder ed b y the aut omatic sta y. Inexplicably , REI did not r ecor d the deed prior t o this
cour t's imposition of the aut omatic sta y. This failur e to recor d has consequences under section 1322(c). Stated simply , the for eclosed pr oper ty is not “ sold” at any interim point of the pr ocess, including the
auction or deliv ery of the r esulting mor tgagee 's deed, until the conclusion of the entir e process. Merely accepting the highest bid ma y “conclude ” a sale for purposes of Arkansas law but does not
render the pr oper ty “sold” for purposes of f eder al law pursuant t o 11 U.S.C. § 1322(c). A number of
reasons justify this conclusion.

The
sale auction occurr ed prior t o the debt ors filing bankruptcy , and the trustee 's deed fr om the sale was
executed but not r ecor ded. The mo vants ar gued that the for eclosur e sale was complete prior t o the bankruptcy filing, and, under
Arkansas law , the debt ors lost their right of r edemption when the pr oper ty was sold at auction. Judge
Barry stated. If the Cour t wer e to consider only Arkansas law , the mo vant ma y be corr ect. Arkansas law pr ovides that
a “sale” is defined as “the public auction conducted pursuant t o § 18–50–107. ” Ark. Code Ann. § 18-50-

It is

with a sale of the v ehicle, Ms. Cloninger testified that no ex cess pr oceeds would exist in a hypothetical
chapter 7 liquidation. The Cour t acknowledges that costs would be associated with the liquidation of the
vehicle, and that Ms. Cloninger listed the r etail v alue of the v ehicle in her schedules. The Cour t also
acknowledges that a chapter 7 trustee would be entitled t o a statut ory commission fr om any sale of the

¶6 The par ties agr ee this cour t's jurisdiction is go verned b y section 25A.004(d) of the Texas Go vernment
Code. See Tex. Go v't Code § 25A.004(d). This section pr ovides this cour t has jurisdiction o ver actions
that arise out of a qualified tr ansaction when the amount in contr oversy ex ceeds $10 million, ex cluding
monetar y requests not at issue her e. See id. Under the statute, a “ ‘ qualified tr ansaction ’ means a
transaction ․  under which a par ty: (A) pa ys or r eceiv es, or is obligated t o pa y or is entitled t o receiv e,
consider ation with an aggr egate v alue of at least $10 million. ” See id. § 25A.001(14). Her e, Def endant
challenges Plaintiff 's amount in contr oversy asser tion thr ough a plea t o the jurisdiction. ¶7 Plea t o the jurisdiction jurisprudence is well established in Texas. As stated b y the Texas Supr eme
Cour t:
A plea t o the jurisdiction is a dilat ory plea, the purpose of which is t o def eat a cause of action without
regar d to whether the claims asser ted ha ve merit.

[Document: TEN 31 LLC SUMMER MOON HOLDINGS LLC v. JOHN TARBOX JORDAN VIMONT CU DESIGNATED MANAGER LLC CU DESIGNATED MANAGER LLC (2025) _ FindLaw, Relevance: 0.19]
Def endants pleaded that the amount in contr oversy ex ceeds $5 million; C Ten has not pleaded
other wise. The first step in analyzing jurisdiction is typically a pleadings bur den. Whether filing in the Business
Cour t or a district cour t, a plaintiff must plead facts that affirmativ ely show the jurisdiction of the cour t in
which the action is br ought, including that the r elief sought is within the cour t's amount-in-contr oversy
limits,63 and a par ty remo ving an action t o this Cour t must “ plead facts t o establish ․  the business
cour t's authority t o hear the action. ”64 Feder al cour ts lik ewise r equir e complaints and r emo val notices t o
allege facts establishing jurisdiction, including any minimum amount in contr oversy.65
Rule 355 uses the term “ plead” with r espect t o the jurisdictional allegations in a notice of r emo val.66
Thus, while the term “ pleading” often r efers only t o petitions and answers, the jurisdictional allegations in
Defendants' notice of r emo val ar e par t of the “ pleadings” for these purposes.

[Document: ET GATHERING PROCESSING LLC v. TELLURIAN PRODUCTION LLC (2025) _ FindLaw, Relevance: 0.20]
Def endant explains Plaintiff initially filed an
action against it in state district cour t, but after engaging in disco very, Plaintiff non-suited its action and
re-filed it in this cour t, changing its allegation t o indicate the amount in contr oversy ex ceeds $10 million. Defendant contends this jurisdictional allegation is false. F or suppor t, it points t o inv oices amounting t o
appr oximately 8.2 million; these inv oices r eflect the gathering and pr ocessing f ees billed b y a thir d par ty
for gas deliv ered to it b y Def endant fr om the dedicated acr eage. The cour t notes Def endant maintains its
actions did not amount t o a br each of a contr act. In addition t o its sham allegation, Def endant contends
Plaintiff is entitled t o recover only the benefit of the bar gain and Plaintiff did not actually incur any
expenses because it did not gather and pr ocess any gas fr om the dedicated acr eage. ¶5 In r esponse, Plaintiff asser ts it pleaded facts suppor ting its asser tion that the amount in contr oversy
amounts t o mor e than $10 million.

[Document: TEN 31 LLC SUMMER MOON HOLDINGS LLC v. JOHN TARBOX JORDAN VIMONT CU DESIGNATED MANAGER LLC CU DESIGNATED MANAGER LLC (2025) _ FindLaw, Relevance: 0.70]
Construing the
pleadings liber ally in fa vor of jurisdiction and “look[ing] t o the pleader 's intent, ”69 the Cour t holds that
Defendants ha ve inv oked the jurisdiction of this Cour t, and at a minimum, the amount-in-contr oversy
allegations do not establish a lack of jurisdiction, such that Def endants would be entitled t o amend.70
The Texas Supr eme Cour t has stated that, when an action is br ought t o protect a right or privilege, “[t]he
subjectiv e value of a privilege, if asser ted in good faith, establishes jurisdiction if that v alue meets the
requisite amount in contr oversy.”71 Independent of their other allegations, Def endants ha ve pleaded that
the v alue of the rights at issue ex ceeds $5 million. With r espect t o Def endants' asser tion that the rights at issue implicate the entir e value of Summer
Moon, the Cour t views this as unlik ely.

[Document: TEN 31 LLC SUMMER MOON HOLDINGS LLC v. JOHN TARBOX JORDAN VIMONT CU DESIGNATED MANAGER LLC CU DESIGNATED MANAGER LLC (2025) _ FindLaw, Relevance: 0.48]
As the United States
Supr eme Cour t has obser ved, it would be “ anomalous” t o treat the jurisdictional allegations in a
complaint diff erently than fr om those in a notice of r emo val.67
CTen's petitions, including the second and thir d amended petitions filed in this Cour t, are silent with
respect t o whether the action meets the Cour t's amount-in-contr oversy minimum.68 But Def endants
plead in their notice of r emo val that the v alue of the rights at issue ex ceeds $5 million.

SANDEEP YADAV 3T FEDERAL SOLUTIONS LLC v. RAJEEVA AGRAWAL POONAM AGARWAL (2025) _ FindLaw,"What is the jurisdictional issue in this case, and how does it relate to the date of September 1, 2024?","Based on the information provided in the legal documents, the jurisdictional issue in this case relates to the creation of the Texas Business Court and its jurisdictional limitations. The key date of September 1, 2024, is significant because it marks the effective date for the application of certain laws related to civil actions in the Business Court.

Specifically, House Bill 19, which established the Texas Business Court, applies only to civil actions commenced on or after September 1, 2024. The court in this case had to determine whether it had jurisdiction over claims that were brought before that date and whether those claims could be considered part of the same ""action"" as claims brought afterward.

The court concluded that the original lawsuit was brought too early to fall within the Business Court's jurisdiction under the new law. As a result, the court granted a motion to remand the entire case back to the district court. This decision was based on the interpretation of the jurisdictional provisions and the effective date specified in the relevant statutes.

In summary, the jurisdictional issue in this case revolves around the timing of the claims filed in relation to the establishment of the Texas Business Court and the specific date of September 1, 2024, which determines the applicability of the new laws governing civil actions in that court.","[Document: YADAV 3T LLC v.

Plaintiff, v . Rajee va AGRA WAL and P oonam Agar wal, Def endants. Cause No. 24-BC03B-0003
Decided: F ebruar y 11, 2025
OPINION AND ORDER
I. Intr oduction
¶1 House Bill 19—the statute that cr eated the Texas Business Cour t and defines its jurisdiction—applies
only “t o civil actions commenced on or after September 1, 2024. ”1 In this case, some claims wer e
brought befor e that date, and other claims wer e brought after ward. All wer e brought in the same lawsuit. The Cour t must decide whether it has jurisdiction of the original lawsuit br ought befor e September 1,
2024, and whether later filed claims ar e par t of the same “ action. ” Because the Cour t concludes that the
original lawsuit was br ought t oo early t o fit within this Cour t's jurisdiction and all of the claims ar e par t of
one “ action, ” the Cour t grants the motion t o remand the entir e case t o the district cour t.
II.

[Document: LONE STAR NGL PRODUCT SERVICES LLC v. EAGLECLAW MIDSTREAM VENTURES LLC CR LLC (2024) _ FindLaw, Relevance: 0.73]
And as this Cour t knows, when that cour t began t o exist on September 1st, 2024, all of the existing
appeals that wer e within that cour t's jurisdiction, wer e transf erred to that cour t. And that cour t had
subject-matter jurisdiction t o adjudicate those appeals and has been adjudicating those appeals and the
constitutionality of that cour t has been upheld b y the Texas Supr eme Cour t. And so Section 8 as an
effectiv e date is not a subject-matter limitation on the Cour t.48
¶25 The Cour t recogniz es that Section 1.15(a) of S.B. 1045 states as follows: “The changes in law made
by this Act apply t o appeals per fected on or after September 1, 2024. ”49 Howe ver, brief scrutiny of
Section 1.15 r eveals a section (b), which was neither discussed b y the P arties at or al ar gument nor
mirrored in H.B.

[Document: LONE STAR NGL PRODUCT SERVICES LLC v. EAGLECLAW MIDSTREAM VENTURES LLC CR LLC (2024) _ FindLaw, Relevance: 0.30]
19 unambiguously oper ates as a jurisdictional pr ovision when
applied t o Texas Go vernment Code Section 25A.004 (entitled “Jurisdiction and P owers”).47 Ther efore,
the Cour t holds that par ties t o a “ civil action[ ] commenced” befor e September 1, 2024 ma y not waiv e
Section 8' s “effectiv e date ” provision in or der t o establish subject-matter jurisdiction in the Business
Cour t under Section 25A.004. iii. Because the text of S.B. 1045 explicitly pr ovides for the tr ansf er of pr e-September 1, 2024 appeals,
the P arties’ analysis of its eff ectiv e date pr ovision does not withstand scrutiny .4/7/25, 11:28 AM LONE STAR NGL PRODUCT SERVICES LLC v. EAGLECLAW MIDSTREAM VENTURES LLC CR LLC (2024) | FindLaw

¶24 A t the hearing, the P arties added an ar gument that Section 8 is not a jurisdictional limitation on this
Cour t by comparing it t o S.B. 1045, which cr eated the Fifteenth Cour t of Appeals:
Senate Bill 1045, Section 1.1[5], has an almost identical eff ectiv e date pr ovision that sa ys the changes in
law made b y this act, Senate Bill No. 1045, apply t o appeals per fected on or after September 1st, 2024.

   - They claim that Yadav unlawfully operated the company and engaged in blatant self-dealing, causing harm to the company.

BERTUCCI LP LLC SLP LLC v. WATKINS (2025) _ FindLaw,"What was the nature of the business relationship between Bertucci and Watkins, and how did they divide responsibilities and profits in their joint ventures?","Based on the information provided in the legal documents, Bertucci and Watkins had a business relationship where Bertucci provided funding for projects in exchange for a sixty-percent interest, while Watkins provided industry expertise and day-to-day management for a forty-percent interest. They did not create an umbrella entity to own and develop their properties and projects but instead created new entities for each separate project. These entities typically included partnerships where Bertucci and Watkins were limited partners, along with a corporation where they were 60/40 shareholders.

Watkins managed the funds of these entities using a bank account owned by Texas Community Builders, LP (TCBLP), a separate partnership that Watkins and his wife created for their own businesses. Watkins commingled the funds of the B-W entities with TCBLP funds and personal funds. Watkins argued that he did not owe a formal fiduciary duty to Bertucci individually because they were both members of the limited liability companies and limited partners in the partnerships. Watkins also contended that no informal fiduciary relationship had arisen between them as partners.

In summary, Bertucci and Watkins had a joint venture where Bertucci provided funding and Watkins contributed expertise and management, with a specific division of responsibilities and profits as outlined in their business arrangement for each project they undertook.","[Document: BERTUCCI LP LLC SLP LLC v.

Watkins' s arguments, claiming that any distinction between the companies and Ber tucci individually was
“of no consequence ” because Ber tucci pleaded both individual and deriv ative claims. Other than that
statement, he wholly failed t o engage in W atkins' s arguments on this point. Bertucci again had an oppor tunity t o submit facts and ar gument suppor ting his asser tion that W atkins

The key date of September 1, 2024, is significant because it marks the effective date for the Texas Business Court to have jurisdiction over civil actions commenced on or after that date.

In this case, the court needs to determine whether it has jurisdiction over claims that were brought before September 1, 2024, as well as claims that were brought afterward but are part of the same lawsuit. The court must decide if the original lawsuit brought before September 1, 2024, falls within the Texas Business Court's jurisdiction or if it was filed too early. Additionally, the court needs to establish whether the later-filed claims are part of the same legal action.

Ultimately, the court's decision will impact whether the case should be remanded to the district court or if it falls under the jurisdiction of the Texas Business Court based on the specific provisions outlined in the relevant statutes and legal documents.","[Document: YADAV 3T LLC v.

FINDL AW CASE L AW TEXAS  THE BUSINESS COUR T OF TEXAS  YADAV 3T  LLC V. AGRA WAL
YADAV 3T  LLC v. AGRA WAL (2025)
The Business Cour t of Texas. Sandeep Y ADAV individually and deriv atively on behalf of 3T  Feder al Solutions, LL C,
Plaintiff, v . Rajee va AGRA WAL and P oonam Agar wal, Def endants. Cause No. 24-BC03B-0003
Decided: F ebruar y 11, 2025
OPINION AND ORDER
I. Intr oduction
¶1 House Bill 19—the statute that cr eated the Texas Business Cour t and defines its jurisdiction—applies
only “t o civil actions commenced on or after September 1, 2024. ”1 In this case, some claims wer e
brought befor e that date, and other claims wer e brought after ward. All wer e brought in the same lawsuit. The Cour t must decide whether it has jurisdiction of the original lawsuit br ought befor e September 1,
2024, and whether later filed claims ar e par t of the same “ action. ” Because the Cour t concludes that the
original lawsuit was br ought t oo early t o fit within this Cour t's jurisdiction and all of the claims ar e par t of
one “ action, ” the Cour t grants the motion t o remand the entir e case t o the district cour t.

And as this Cour t knows, when that cour t began t o exist on September 1st, 2024, all of the existing
appeals that wer e within that cour t's jurisdiction, wer e transf erred to that cour t. And that cour t had
subject-matter jurisdiction t o adjudicate those appeals and has been adjudicating those appeals and the
constitutionality of that cour t has been upheld b y the Texas Supr eme Cour t. And so Section 8 as an
effectiv e date is not a subject-matter limitation on the Cour t.48
¶25 The Cour t recogniz es that Section 1.15(a) of S.B. 1045 states as follows: “The changes in law made
by this Act apply t o appeals per fected on or after September 1, 2024. ”49 Howe ver, brief scrutiny of
Section 1.15 r eveals a section (b), which was neither discussed b y the P arties at or al ar gument nor
mirrored in H.B.

19 unambiguously oper ates as a jurisdictional pr ovision when
applied t o Texas Go vernment Code Section 25A.004 (entitled “Jurisdiction and P owers”).47 Ther efore,
the Cour t holds that par ties t o a “ civil action[ ] commenced” befor e September 1, 2024 ma y not waiv e
Section 8' s “effectiv e date ” provision in or der t o establish subject-matter jurisdiction in the Business
Cour t under Section 25A.004. iii. Because the text of S.B. 1045 explicitly pr ovides for the tr ansf er of pr e-September 1, 2024 appeals,
the P arties’ analysis of its eff ectiv e date pr ovision does not withstand scrutiny .4/7/25, 11:28 AM LONE STAR NGL PRODUCT SERVICES LLC v. EAGLECLAW MIDSTREAM VENTURES LLC CR LLC (2024) | FindLaw

¶24 A t the hearing, the P arties added an ar gument that Section 8 is not a jurisdictional limitation on this
Cour t by comparing it t o S.B. 1045, which cr eated the Fifteenth Cour t of Appeals:
Senate Bill 1045, Section 1.1[5], has an almost identical eff ectiv e date pr ovision that sa ys the changes in
law made b y this act, Senate Bill No. 1045, apply t o appeals per fected on or after September 1st, 2024.

1. **Agrawals' Counterclaims**: The Agrawals filed counterclaims against Yadav, alleging that he has been illegally operating the company, 3T Federal, as a de facto manager and has systematically damaged the company through self-dealing.

2. **3T Federal's Claims**: 3T Federal intervened in the lawsuit, claiming that Yadav unlawfully usurped the authority of the company's manager, Rajeeva Agrawal, by locking him out as the manager of 3T Federal.

The underlying disputes between the parties involve a long-standing corporate governance dispute among the three members of 3T Federal. Each side contends that they are the rightful manager of the company. The claims and counterclaims revolve around issues of company management, self-dealing, and alleged unlawful actions by the parties involved.

YADAV 3T LLC v. AGRAWAL (2025) _ FindLaw,"What is the significance of the prior judgment from Virginia mentioned in the case, and how does it relate to the current dispute over control of 3T Federal Solutions LLC?","The prior judgment from Virginia mentioned in the case is significant because it determined that each member of 3T Federal Solutions LLC had 1/3 of the voting power, and the Agrawals had the necessary voting power to validly remove Yadav as the manager. This judgment established the ownership and management structure of the company, indicating that Yadav was no longer the manager due to the Agrawals' actions.

In the current dispute over control of 3T Federal Solutions LLC, the prior judgment from Virginia serves as a foundational decision that the parties are referencing to support their claims and positions. The Agrawals and 3T Federal Solutions LLC are alleging that Yadav breached the operating agreement by refusing to acknowledge Rajeeva Agrawal's appointment as Manager, exerting control over the company despite the Agrawals' majority voting rights, and acting as the de facto manager. They are seeking declaratory judgment to void Yadav's actions, including transferring assets, borrowing money, and competing with the company, among other allegations.

Overall, the prior judgment from Virginia plays a crucial role in establishing the ownership and management dynamics of 3T Federal Solutions LLC, which forms the backdrop for the current dispute over control and alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by Yadav.","[Document: SANDEEP YADAV 3T FEDERAL SOLUTIONS LLC v.

ARIZONA ET AL. v. NAVAJO NATION ET AL. (2023) _ FindLaw,What is the purpose of the 1868 peace treaty between the United States and the Navajo Tribe?,"The purpose of the 1868 peace treaty between the United States and the Navajo Tribe was to establish the Navajo Reservation, providing the Navajo Tribe with a ""permanent home"" on their original homeland in the western United States. The treaty aimed to end all wars between the parties and allocate a large reservation for the Navajo Tribe's use and occupation. Additionally, the treaty included provisions for the United States to assist the Navajo Tribe in becoming self-sufficient by building infrastructure like schools and providing resources like seeds.

Regarding water rights, while the treaty reserved necessary water to accomplish the purpose of the Navajo Reservation, it did not impose an affirmative duty on the United States to secure water for the Tribe. The extent of the Navajo Tribe's water rights remains unadjudicated, and the United States holds some of the Tribe's water rights in trust. The treaty did not explicitly mention water-related obligations of the United States, and the historical record does not indicate that the United States agreed to undertake efforts to secure water for the Navajos beyond what was explicitly stated in the treaty.","[Document: ARIZONA ET AL. v.

An 1868 peace tr eaty between the United States and the Na vajo Tribe established the Na vajo
Reser vation that t oday spans some 17 million acr es, almost entir ely in the Color ado Riv er Basin of the
western United States. The F eder al Go vernment' s reser vation of land for an Indian tribe implicitly
reser ves the right t o use needed water fr om v arious sour ces--such as gr oundwater , rivers, str eams, lak es,
and springs--that arise on, bor der, cross, underlie, or ar e encompassed within the r eser vation. See
Winters  v. United States , 207 U. S. 564, 576-577. While the Tribe has the right t o use needed water fr om
the r eser vation 's numer ous water sour ces, the Na vajos face the same water scar city pr oblem that many
in the western United States face.

The Navajos argue that the United States should take affirmative steps to secure necessary water for the Tribe. These steps include assessing the Tribe's water needs, developing a plan to secure the needed water, and potentially constructing water infrastructure such as pipelines, pumps, wells, or other facilities.

The Navajo Nation is seeking the government to fulfill its duty under the 1868 treaty by actively securing water for the Tribe, rather than merely refraining from interfering with their reserved water rights. They argue that the United States must go beyond passive non-interference and take proactive measures to ensure water access for the Navajo people, as outlined in the treaty.

In summary, the Navajo Nation is requesting that the federal government assess their water needs, create a plan to secure the required water, and potentially build necessary water infrastructure to meet the Tribe's water requirements.","[Document: ARIZONA ET AL. v.

The United States, we know , must act in a
""legally [a]dequate "" way when it comes t o the Na vajo's water it holds in trust. Arizona II , 460 U. S., at 627. It follows, as the United States concedes, that the f eder al go vernment could not ""legally "" dam off the
water flowing t o their Reser vation, as doing so would ""inter fere with [the Tribe's] ex ercise of their "" water
rights. Tr. of Or al Ar g. 13. Implicit in that concession is another . Because Winters  rights belong t o the
Navajo themselv es, the United States cannot lawfully div ert them elsewher e--just as a lawy er cannot
dispose of a client' s proper ty entrusted t o him without permission. And the only way to ensur e

The specific rule at issue in this case prohibits the possession of radioactive material without a license. The plaintiff, a landowner, seeks a declaration that the rule does not apply to it, arguing that the radioactive personal property on its land is owned and held by other parties who are licensed. This declaration would address the agency's efforts to fine the landowner for violating the rule.

The rule at issue is the prohibition of possessing radioactive material without a license. The key legal concept discussed in this context is the plaintiff's standing to challenge the rule's applicability and seek a declaration regarding its non-applicability. Standing refers to a party's legal right to bring a lawsuit or challenge based on a sufficient connection to the issue in dispute. In this case, the court determined that the landowner has standing to challenge the rule's applicability and seek a declaration because it could be affected by the agency's enforcement actions related to the rule.","[Document: KENSINGTON TITLE NEVADA LLC v.

the face of the instrument. Restatement (Second) of Conflicts § 215 (1971). In the pr esent case, the
Cour t does not find notice on the face of any of the cashier 's checks. Thus, because the instruments
were deliv ered b y Maxine Wilson t o Community State Bank in Arkansas, Arkansas law will go vern. Defendant Mar vin ar gues that because Inter venor Wilson and Jennif er Wilson engaged in alleged
fraudulent activity , the funds should be unwound and giv en to the State of Louisiana. Inter venor Wilson
argues that the funds should be unwound and giv en to him because he is a joint owner , and the funds
are subject t o community pr oper ty. At this time, the Cour t does not find that it has sufficient facts fr om either par ty to proceed on this issue.

[Document: COMMUNITY STATE BANK v. Gary Wilson, Intervenor (2022) _ FindLaw, Relevance: 0.63]
It is undisputed that the question of whether the
deposits can be unwound turns on whether Maxine had a good faith belief that Jennif er was aliv e when
the checks wer e deposited. Because of this, the only question pr esented on the cr oss motions is
whether ther e is a genuine issue of material fact r egar ding whether Wilson deposited the checks in good
faith. Howe ver, even if the facts ar e undisputed, neither par ty will be entitled t o summar y judgment as a
matter of law if a fact finder could r easonably r esolv e any inf erences that arise out of those undisputed
facts in fa vor of either par ty. Befor e turning t o the facts howe ver, the Cour t must determine what law go verns the issue of unwinding
transactions. In its pr evious or der, the Cour t specifically held that Arkansas law of agency go verns
whether the deposits can be unwound. Howe ver, Arkansas law itself does not end the Cour t's choice of
law analysis.

Maxine, who had authority under a power of attorney to handle Jennifer's financial matters, was informed about the existence of the letter after Jennifer's car was found abandoned on a bridge. However, Maxine was not immediately shown the contents of the letter.

Maxine alleges was in fur therance of Jennif er's wishes. Ther e is no other e vidence in the r ecor d
establishing whether Maxine knew any additional information at the time the checks wer e deposited. Marvin ar gues that it was unr easonable for Maxine t o assume that Jennif er was aliv e under these
circumstances. In r esponse, Wilson points t o evidence which could indicate that Maxine had a sincer e

Unwinding Transactions
The Cour t now looks t o whether the deposit made b y Maxine Wilson with an inv alid power of att orne y
agreement should be unwound. First, the Cour t must determine whether Arkansas law or Louisiana law
governs the unwinding.6 The Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws states that the law of the state
wher e the instrument, the cashier 's checks, is deliv ered go verns unless ther e is notice of the contr ary on
the face of the instrument. Restatement (Second) of Conflicts § 215 (1971). In the pr esent case, the
Cour t does not find notice on the face of any of the cashier 's checks. Thus, because the instruments
were deliv ered b y Maxine Wilson t o Community State Bank in Arkansas, Arkansas law will go vern. Defendant Mar vin ar gues that because Inter venor Wilson and Jennif er Wilson engaged in alleged
fraudulent activity , the funds should be unwound and giv en to the State of Louisiana. Inter venor Wilson
argues that the funds should be unwound and giv en to him because he is a joint owner , and the funds
are subject t o community pr oper ty. At this time, the Cour t does not find that it has sufficient facts fr om either par ty to proceed on this issue.

"Pitts, et al., Petitioners, v. Rivas, et al., Respondents (2025) _ FindLaw","What is the ""anti-fracturing rule"" mentioned in the document, and how does it apply to the plaintiffs' claims in this case?","The ""anti-fracturing rule"" mentioned in the document appears to be a rule that prohibits the possession of radioactive material without a license. In the context provided, the plaintiffs in the case seek a declaration that this rule does not apply to them. They argue that the radioactive personal property on their land is owned and held by other parties who are licensed, and therefore, the rule should not be enforced against them.

The plaintiffs' claims in this case involve challenging the applicability of the anti-fracturing rule to their specific situation. By seeking a declaration that the rule does not apply to them due to the ownership and licensing of the radioactive material on their land, the plaintiffs are engaging in a proper rule-applicability challenge within the scope of the statute. This means they are contesting whether the rule should be applied to them based on the specific circumstances they have presented.

In summary, the anti-fracturing rule mentioned in the document is a rule prohibiting the possession of radioactive material without a license, and the plaintiffs in this case are challenging the applicability of this rule to their situation by seeking a declaration that it does not apply to them.","[Document: KENSINGTON TITLE NEVADA LLC v.

A. Wif e Formed a Sole Pr opriet orship Befor e the P arties' Married. The e vidence establishes that Wif e created a sole pr opriet orship prior the par ties' marriage. The purpose
of this sole pr opriet orship was t o provide br anding, mark eting, and adv ertising ser vices t o corpor ate
clients. The par ties filed a joint income tax r eturn for the 1984 tax y ear. This tax r eturn contains a Schedule C,
which r eflects that Wif e oper ated a sole pr opriet orship in 1984. The 1984 Schedule C also indicates that
Wife included a business deduction for the depr eciation of assets, namely a computer and an answering
machine.

The F orm 4562, which was also attached t o the 1984 r eturn,
shows that Wif e took a full y ear of depr eciation for these assets and the assets wer e placed in ser vice at
the beginning of the 1984 tax y ear, prior t o the par ties' marriage in June 1984. In addition, Wif e obtained
an Emplo yer Identification Number (“EIN”) for her sole pr opriet orship on Januar y 1, 1984. Business

purposes, is Januar y 1, 1984. Exper t testimony pr ovided b y Gregor y Cowhe y was that had Wif e not
started her business until after the date of marriage on June 10, 1984, only a par tial y ear's depr eciation
would ha ve been tak en, not the full y ear as shown on the 1984 Schedule C.
Sometime in 1984, Wif e ceased per forming work thr ough the Kr ell Corpor ation and only work ed thr ough

Unwinding Transactions
The Cour t now looks t o whether the deposit made b y Maxine Wilson with an inv alid power of att orne y
agreement should be unwound. First, the Cour t must determine whether Arkansas law or Louisiana law
governs the unwinding.6 The Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws states that the law of the state
wher e the instrument, the cashier 's checks, is deliv ered go verns unless ther e is notice of the contr ary on
the face of the instrument. Restatement (Second) of Conflicts § 215 (1971). In the pr esent case, the
Cour t does not find notice on the face of any of the cashier 's checks. Thus, because the instruments
were deliv ered b y Maxine Wilson t o Community State Bank in Arkansas, Arkansas law will go vern. Defendant Mar vin ar gues that because Inter venor Wilson and Jennif er Wilson engaged in alleged
fraudulent activity , the funds should be unwound and giv en to the State of Louisiana. Inter venor Wilson

and back ground principles of Indian law--secur es for the Na vajo some measur e of water rights. Y et even
today the extent of those water rights r emains unadjudicated and ther efore unknown. What is known is
that the United States holds some of the Tribe's water rights in trust. And it ex ercises contr ol over many

everyone had found the water at Bosque Redondo insufficient and because the Na vajo's str ong desir e to

DEPARTMENT OF SERVICES FOR CHILDREN YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES DSCYF v. GARCIAS (2013) _ FindLaw,"What is the procedural history of the case, and what events led to the children entering the care and custody of DSCYF?","Based on the information provided in the legal documents, the procedural history of the case involves a series of hearings that began in late 2008 and extended through 2009, 2010, and 2011. During these hearings, the Court determined that the children, E.B. and J.B., were dependent and in the care of their parents. Mother and father were provided with case plans for reunification, and legal counsel was appointed for them. The Court reviewed the parents' progress under their case plans and monitored how the children were faring in foster care.

Ultimately, by an Order dated March 30, 2012, the Court determined that the appropriate permanency goal for the children was Termination of Parental Rights (TPR). The Department of Services for Children, Youth, and their Families (DSCYF) was directed to file a Petition for Termination and Transfer of Parental Rights within thirty days. Subsequently, DSCYF filed the petition requesting the termination of the parental rights of both mother and father over the children.

The events that led to the children entering the care and custody of DSCYF include concerns about the mother's history of substance abuse, her whereabouts being unknown, and her inability to provide adequate care for the children. The Court found that the mother had failed to plan for the children's physical needs or mental health and development, which resulted in the children remaining in foster care for an extended period of time. The grounds for termination of the mother's parental rights included failure to plan for the children's needs, as outlined in 13 Del.

Mother
complied with the terms of her pr obation and was not subsequently found in violation. Ther efore, Mother
made adequate pr ogress on this element of her Case Plan. Overall, howe ver, Mother has failed t o meet all the Case Plan 's requir ed elements. Based on Mother 's
lack of pr ogress on her Case Plan, the Cour t finds the e vidence is clear and convincing that Mother has
failed t o adequately plan for the childr en's physical needs or mental and emotional health and

"CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (2025) _ FindLaw","What is the significance of the ""permit shield"" provision in the Clean Water Act, and how does it relate to the concept of end-result requirements?","The ""permit shield"" provision in the Clean Water Act is significant because it offers protection to permittees who comply with the terms of their permits. This provision essentially states that if an entity adheres to the conditions outlined in its permit, it is considered compliant with the Clean Water Act. This shield provision is valuable because it helps permit holders avoid hefty penalties that may be imposed for violations of the Act.

In the context provided, the permit shield provision is related to the concept of end-result requirements. End-result requirements refer to the desired outcome or goal that a permittee must achieve, such as maintaining a certain level of water quality. The text suggests that the permit shield provision could be undermined if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were to impose a permit condition holding the permittee responsible for any drop in water quality below accepted standards, even if the permittee followed all other permit terms diligently. This scenario raises concerns about the fairness to permittees and the effectiveness of the permit shield provision in protecting them from penalties.

Additionally, the text discusses the EPA's interpretation of certain provisions of the Clean Water Act and highlights potential conflicts between the EPA's approach and the permit shield provision. It also points out the absence of provisions addressing situations where multiple permittees discharge into a body of water with substandard water quality, further emphasizing the complexities and challenges in applying the permit shield provision in certain contexts.","[Document: CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA v.

     The first is the so-called "" permit shield"" pr ovision, 33 U. S. C. §1342(k), under which a permittee is
deemed t o be in compliance with the CW A if it follows all the terms in its permit. This pr otection is v ery
valuable because violations of the CW A, even if entir ely inadv ertent, ar e subject t o hefty penalties. The
CWA imposes a r egime of strict civil liability , see, e.g., United States  v. Allegheny L udlum Corp ., 366 F . 3d
164, 174 (CA3 2004), and a par ty that violates a permit term ma y be fined up t o $25,000 per da y per
violation. §1319(d). As San F rancisco explains, it ma y tak e months t o gather the information necessar y
to detect a dr op below the applicable water quality standar ds, see Tr. of Or al Ar g. 16, and after
substandar d water quality is detected, it ma y tak e some time t o de vise and implement appr opriate
correctiv e measur es.

[Document: CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (2025) _ FindLaw, Relevance: 0.46]
But the benefit of this pr ovision would be e viscer ated if the EP A could impose a permit
provision making the permittee r esponsible for any dr op in water quality below the accepted standar d. A
permittee could do e verything r equir ed b y all the other permit terms. It could de vise a car eful plan for
protecting water quality , and it could diligently implement that plan. But if, in the end, the quality of the
water in its r eceiving waters dr opped below the applicable water quality le vels, it would face dir e
potential consequences. It is ther efore exceedingly har d to reconcile the Go vernment' s interpr etation of
§1311(b)(1)(C ) with the permit shield. And contr ary to the Go vernment' s contention, the possibility that a
cour t might ultimately ex ercise its ""br oad discr etion "" to mitigate penalties, see Brief for Respondent 44
(internal quotation marks omitted), is not enough t o mak e up for disarming the shield. 2
     One final structur al featur e cements the case against the EP A's interpr etation: the absence of any
provision dealing with the pr oblem that arises when mor e than one permittee dischar ges int o a body of
water with substandar d water quality .

[Document: CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (2025) _ FindLaw, Relevance: 0.38]
A
     W e begin with the text of §1311(b)(1)(C ), which, as noted, r equir es a permit t o contain, in addition t o
""effluent limitations, "" ""any mor e stringent limitation "" that is "" necessar y to meet "" certain "" water quality
standar ds"" that ar e imposed under state law "" or any other f eder al law or r egulation ""; and "" any mor e
stringent limitation "" that is ""r equir ed to implement any applicable water quality standar d established
pursuant t o this chapter ."" (Emphasis added.) All the italiciz ed terms in the pr eceding sentence suggest
that the most natur al reading of §1311(b)(1)(C ) is that it authoriz es the EP A to set rules that a permittee
must follow in or der t o achie ve a desir ed result, namely , a cer tain degr ee of water quality . W e star t with the term ""limitation. "" As used in the r elevant context, a limitation is a ""r estriction or
restraint imposed from without  (as b y law[)]. "" Webster 's Third New International Dictionar y 1312 (1976)
(emphasis added). A pr ovision that tells a permittee that it must do cer tain specific things plainly
qualifies as a limitation. Such a pr ovision imposes a r estriction ""fr om without. ""

This agreement clarifies that the authority, jurisdiction, and venue exist in the Texas Business Court for the claims and causes of action covered by the agreement.

The Rule 11 Agreement is relevant to the jurisdiction of the Texas Business Court because it confirms the parties' mutual understanding that the dispute at hand is within the scope of cases that can be heard by the Texas Business Court under the specific provisions outlined in Chapter 25A of the Texas Government Code. This agreement helps define the parameters within which the Texas Business Court can exercise its authority over the case in question.","[Document: LONE STAR NGL PRODUCT SERVICES LLC v.

v. (2013) _ FindLaw,"What is the current permanency goal for the children E.B. and J.B., and what is DFS seeking to change it to?","Based on the information provided in the legal documents, the current permanency goal for the children E.B. and J.B. is Termination of Parental Rights (TPR). The Department of Services for Children, Youth, and Their Families (DFS) sought to change this goal to Adoption (APPLA) for E.B. and J.B. The CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) argued against this change, stating that TPR is in the children's best interest and that there have been no significant changes justifying a switch from TPR to APPLA. 

The documents indicate that there have been hearings and court orders regarding the children's care since 2008, with the court initially determining that the children were dependent on their parents. Eventually, the court decided that TPR was the appropriate permanency goal for E.B. and J.B., leading DFS to file a petition for the termination and transfer of parental rights. However, later evidence and testimony suggested that APPLA might be a more suitable goal given the children's improved circumstances and relationships with their mother and potential long-term placement with Mr. P and his wife.","[Document: v.

not obtain medicine or counseling for the child because she was not her legal guar dian.2
Through a series of hearings which began in late 2008 and extended thr ough 2009, 2010 and 2011, the

SAFELEASE INSURANCE SERVICES LLC v. STORABLE INC (2025) _ FindLaw,"What is the significance of the deadline for removing an action in the context of this lawsuit, and how does it relate to the court's jurisdictional amount-in-controversy requirements?","In the context of the lawsuits mentioned, the significance of the deadline for removing an action is related to the court's jurisdictional amount-in-controversy requirements. The deadline for removing an action is crucial because it determines when a party can transfer a case from one court to another. In these cases, the deadline for removal is tied to the jurisdictional facts known to the defendant. If a plaintiff delays filing a lawsuit for more than 30 days after the defendant becomes aware of the jurisdictional facts, the defendant may lose the opportunity to timely remove the case to a different court.

Regarding the court's jurisdictional amount-in-controversy requirements, the documents discuss that jurisdiction is pegged to the specific claims or aspects of the suit. The court's jurisdictional grant typically refers to the ""action"" and the minimum amount in controversy required for the court to have jurisdiction over the case. In these cases, the court holds that jurisdiction applies to the listed categories of ""actions"" when the amount in controversy exceeds a certain threshold, such as $5 million.

In summary, the deadline for removing an action is significant as it affects the timing of transferring a case between courts, and it is related to the court's jurisdictional amount-in-controversy requirements, which determine the court's authority to hear cases based on the monetary value involved.","[Document: SAFELEASE INSURANCE SERVICES LLC v.

Regar dless of whether jurisdiction is pegged t o specific claims or some other aspect of the suit,
Subsection (b)' s jurisdictional gr ant, and its minimum amount in contr oversy, refer to the “ action ”: “the
business cour t has civil jurisdiction ․  in the following actions in which the amount in contr oversy
exceeds $5 million ․ ”51 In fact, all of Section 25A.004' s jurisdictional gr ants r efer to the “ action, ”52 save
one: Subsection (f )'s grant of supplemental jurisdiction r efers t o claims instead.53 This mak es sense, as
supplemental jurisdiction typically applies t o only some claims within an action; the cour t gener ally must
have some independent jurisdiction t o which the supplemental jurisdiction can attach.54 Section
25A.004' s jurisdictional car ve-outs, on the other hand, ar e sometimes stated with r eference t o the
“action ” and other times t o specific “ claims. ”55
Applying these common meanings as underst ood within the context of the statute, the Cour t holds that
jurisdiction under Subsection (b) applies t o the listed categories of “ actions” when the amount in
contr oversy in the action ex ceeds $5 million.

[Document: TEN 31 LLC SUMMER MOON HOLDINGS LLC v. JOHN TARBOX JORDAN VIMONT CU DESIGNATED MANAGER LLC CU DESIGNATED MANAGER LLC (2025) _ FindLaw, Relevance: 0.32]
Def endants pleaded that the amount in contr oversy ex ceeds $5 million; C Ten has not pleaded
other wise. The first step in analyzing jurisdiction is typically a pleadings bur den. Whether filing in the Business
Cour t or a district cour t, a plaintiff must plead facts that affirmativ ely show the jurisdiction of the cour t in
which the action is br ought, including that the r elief sought is within the cour t's amount-in-contr oversy
limits,63 and a par ty remo ving an action t o this Cour t must “ plead facts t o establish ․  the business
cour t's authority t o hear the action. ”64 Feder al cour ts lik ewise r equir e complaints and r emo val notices t o
allege facts establishing jurisdiction, including any minimum amount in contr oversy.65
Rule 355 uses the term “ plead” with r espect t o the jurisdictional allegations in a notice of r emo val.66
Thus, while the term “ pleading” often r efers only t o petitions and answers, the jurisdictional allegations in
Defendants' notice of r emo val ar e par t of the “ pleadings” for these purposes.

Firstly, they argue that the court lacks jurisdiction over the matter.

The parties are in dispute over whether the court has jurisdiction over the removed action.

Secondly, the defendants argue that the court does have jurisdiction under Subsection (e) because the action seeks injunctive and declaratory relief and involves a dispute based on a claim within the court's jurisdiction under Subsection (b). They claim that the underlying claims fall within certain categories listed in Subsection (b), which they argue satisfies Subsection (e) regardless of the amount in controversy.

Having decided that Section 25A.004(b)' s $5 million amount-in-contr oversy r equir ement applies her e, the
Cour t must next determine how it applies. As detailed below , the Cour t concludes that the amount in
contr oversy applies at the “ action ” level, considering all claims pr operly joined befor e the Cour t, rather
than as a per claim minimum. Because Section 25A.004 uses the undefined terms “ action ” and “ claim, ” the Cour t is mindful of the
distinction between these two terms and the diff erences in the wa y the statute uses them. When
undefined,40 the Texas Supr eme Cour t has construed the term “ action ” to refer to a lawsuit or judicial
proceeding gener ally and the term “ claim ” to refer to an individual theor y of liability or cause of action
asser ted within a lawsuit or judicial pr oceeding.41 The Fifth Cir cuit has similarly distinguished between
the terms “ action ” and “ claim ” when construing f eder al remo val statutes.42 Consistently , the Texas
