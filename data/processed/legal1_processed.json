Belying this testimony , however, was Trooper Zavala\u2019s  \ntestimony  on cross -examination  as to portions of the sobriety testing that Jones did pass. For example, Trooper Zavala testified that Jones did not start the walk and turn test too \nsoon, he did not stop the walk to turn  and steady himself, he did not raise his arms six \ninches for balance , he did not state that he could not do the test, and he did not step off \nthe line while  walking .

In addition, he was depicted going back to his car  to retrieve a coat, which he zipped up \nwithout exhibiting issues with dexterity. Still other video footage shows that the crash \noccurred as a result of the victim failing to stop at a stop sign and pulling into traffic in \nfront of Jones.
